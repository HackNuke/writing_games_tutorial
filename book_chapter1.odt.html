<P>Let's start with a very simple example of a game. This will be a
game in which a monkey's face travels back and forth across the
screen, and the player must try to &quot;punch&quot; the monkey by
clicking on it. The gameplay will be familiar to anyone who has gone
through the &quot;Chimp Line by Line&quot; [TODO: link] tutorial or
those who have endured annoying banner ads in the early 2000s.

So with that we have a (very simple, but complete) game. It may not
be the most fun game ever written, but that can be fixed by slick box
art and a major motion picture tie-in. Let's leave those concerns for
the marketing department and instead look at the technical details. 
</P>
<P>What we have above is a minimal game. As we add features to it,
the code will grow in complexity. As humans, we are bad at holding
and manipulating complex systems in our brains. 
</P>
<P>Consider what would happen if instead of just punching one monkey,
we wanted to set traps for 3 monkeys. A click of the mouse would
either drop down a trap at the clicked location or reset a sprung
trap if one was already there. What might our main() function look
like? 
</P>

So what happened? Significantly, the block of code that starts with
&quot;for event in pygame.event.get():&quot; has grown. I'm going to
call this the event handling block. Now it's about 10 lines longer.
It contains one new loop, and two new branches (if statements).
Imagine what will happen to the event handling block as each new
feature is added. If your imagination is summoning images of a single
skyscraping ladder of an if / elif, ridden with deep sub-blocks of
loops and branches, countless and tentacle-like, then you are two
things: accurate, and likely on the same medication as myself. 
</P>
<P>Not only will complex code be difficult to hold in your brain, it
also gets in the way of a critical goal - Rapid Development.
Developing software always involves going back to code you've written
in the past to make changes. If the code is complex, you are going to
pay greater time costs for both searching for the code to change, and
for the change itself because it will need to be made in more places.
</P>
<P>Because we humans have trouble with complex systems, we have
developed the techniques of organization and abstraction. We organize
so that we only need to deal with one thing at a time, and we
abstract so that we can manipulate a simple system that is &quot;similar
enough&quot; to the complex system. 
</P>
<P>How can we organize and/or abstract this code to address the
problem of growing complexity as we add more game features? (And
while we're solving that, can we also do ourselves some favours along
the way to make it faster to develop our game?) 
</P>
<P>Luckily for us humans, our brains are *built* for this task. They
are Automatic Abstraction Apparati. We make abstractions every time
we think, and especially when we talk. So one exercise to do is to
simply talk about code. If somebody asked, &quot;What does this
main() function do?&quot;, a reply might go something like &quot;Well,
it does some initialization of the important objects, then it starts
this infinite 'while True:' loop, see? Inside the loop it does this
clock.tick() thing, I'm not really sure what that's for. Anyway, then
it goes through all the 'pygame' events and handles them. After all
that, it calls monkey.update() (we've got to update the monkey every
frame so that it moves), and then it draws everything to the screen.&quot;
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ok, did you catch that? Here you are talking about this
great monkey-punching game you wrote, and you don't even know what
clock.tick() does? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>clock.tick() is used to get a target *frame rate*. We
want the game to look &quot;smooth&quot;. Animation works because if
we see a series of images in quick succession, we are tricked into
thinking we are seeing a moving thing. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Try the example code with 5 as the argument to
clock.tick(). The monkey no longer looks like it is smoothly moving,
instead it is jerking. That's not acceptable for a game, nobody wants
to play with a jerking monkey. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>24 frames per second (FPS) is the rate used in feature
films, and is generally accepted as a minimum for video games. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>By calling clock.tick(60), we are asking the operating
system to *block* this process for 1/60th of a second. When a process
is blocked, it cannot execute any further code, it just sits on a
shelf, gathering nano-dust. When the requested duration is up, the
operating system puts the process back into the mix, and its code can
start executing again. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[[TODO: make sure this is technically accurate. tick()
may actually do better wall-clock FPS simulation by not blocking for
1/60th of a second, but rather 1/60th minus the time it took since
the last call to tick()]] 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So why stop at 60? Why not go up to 120? 240? 2000? There
are a couple reasons. One is that the game gets too fast at those
rates (try it and see). Another is that it heats up the CPU, which
can be uncomfortable when using a laptop. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now that you know that clock.tick() is to block the
process for 1/60th of a second, think about what monkey.update()
does. It's basically just a call to inform the monkey object that
1/60th of a second has passed. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So to summarize what we said, the code is at the base level,
initialization then an infinite loop. Inside that loop there is an
event handling block (here, we include the call to monkey.update() as
part of the event handling block), and then a section where images
are drawn to the screen. Use that summary to organize the code like
so:

</PRE><P>
Look at that code. It's ever so organized. Therefore, problem solved.
We are now great coders who deserve a cookie and a pat on the back.
Don't choke on that cookie. First, ask yourself whether this change
has actually done anything worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>The code has definitely been broken into chunks that have a
semantic distinction for the reader. The functions are named
descriptively, and the lines of code in each function are fewer.
These are all good things. 
</P>
<P>What if we add the 3 traps, 3 monkeys feature discussed above? We
will have to change the code as before *plus* we'll have to change
all the argument passing. Using function arguments as a river to move
your little boats downstream should raise a red flag. 
</P>
<P>Let's start abstracting. See what the code looks like if we add a
module-level variable to contain any and all sprites. [[TODO: justify
module-level variables to the no-globals-kneejerk]]

</PRE><P>
This change adds a few lines of code, but it got the monkey off
main()'s back. If we add 3 monkeys and 3 traps, no changes will be
needed in main() (or in draw_to_display(), for that matter). 
</P>
<P>What we have just done is partially implemented the design
pattern, &quot;Model View Controller&quot; (MVC). 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Design Patterns are a communication tool; they do not
dictate design, they inform the reading of the code. This book makes
use of the design patterns &quot;Model View Controller&quot; (MVC),
&quot;Mediator&quot;, and &quot;Lazy Proxy&quot;. Time won't be spent
describing these patterns in detail, so if they sound foreign to you,
I recommend checking out the book &quot;Design Patterns&quot; by
Gamma et al. or just surfing the web for tutorials. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In our example, the Model is the &quot;sprites&quot; object, it
holds the state of our game, any questions about the authoritative
facts of the game will be directed there. The View the
draw_to_display() function, it shows a representation of the Model on
a Pygame window. 
</P>
<P>We still have the issue of the event handling code growing wildly
as more features are added, but at least we've isolated that problem
to one place. We'l tackle the problem in depth in Chapter 2. 
</P>
<P>If we want to be complete and formal about this MVC pattern, we
may want to also identify Controller components. Identifying a
Controller component is a bit trickier. One might be tempted to say
that the mouse and keyboard are the Controllers. These are indeed
Controllers in one sense, but we don't have objects in our code
representing each. (and one should't add classes to the codebase just
so we can have a more literal match to the Design Pattern) Instead,
these literal devices are represented by the Pygame event queue.
Also, the Pygame Clock object also serves as a Controller. 
</P>
<P>[[TODO: do I make the claim here that all event handling is a
Controller? Come back to this]] 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Rationale Readers with some experience writing games may
be balking at this point, thinking that a MVC architecture is too
abstract, and that it will add unneeded overhead, especially those
whose goal is to create a simple, arcade-style game. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now, historically, arcade games were just that, games
written for arcade machines. The code ran &quot;close to the metal&quot;,
and would squeeze all the resources of the machine just to get a
3-color ghost to flash blue every other frame. In the 21st century,
we have resource-rich personal computers (and phones!) where
applications run a couple layers above the metal. Hence, organizing
your code into a pattern has a small relative cost. For that small
cost, you get the following advantages: more easily add networking,
easily add new views (file loggers, radars, HUDs, multiple zoom
levels, ...), keep the Model code &quot;cleaner&quot; by decoupling
it from the view and the controller, and I contend, more readable
code.
